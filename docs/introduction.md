# Introduction

**AI for Data – Data for AI** is a work program under the World Bank's Development Data Group and Office of the Chief Statistician, focused on advancing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) across the development data lifecycle. The program’s dual mission is to apply AI for improving data (AI for Data), and to ensure data is optimally prepared for AI use (Data for AI).

## Our Approach

AI for Data – Data for AI brings together expertise, methodologies, and tools to address persistent challenges in data quality, usability, and impact. By strategically integrating AI, the program seeks to make development data more accessible, discoverable, and actionable—especially for users and contexts that have been historically underserved as well as making efficient the process of data curation and production for curators and producers of data with limited resources.

### AI for Data

AI for Data involves applying AI techniques to:
- Enhance the quality and consistency of metadata,
- Improve data discoverability and dissemination,
- Monitor and analyze how data is used,
- Optimize user experience in producing and accessing development datasets.

These activities drive improvements and efficiencies throughout the data lifecycle, from curation and validation to dissemination and real-world impact monitoring.

### Data for AI

Data for AI focuses on making development data **AI-ready**. This means structuring, documenting, and sharing indicators, microdata, and other datasets so they can be reliably consumed, analyzed, and acted upon by AI systems. The program supports the adoption of standards and best practices that enable AI models and tools to be built, evaluated, and deployed responsibly for development impact.

## What We Do

Through a set of flagship workstreams—including generative AI for metadata quality, anomaly detection, semantic discovery and retrieval, data use monitoring, and inclusive AI applications—the program demonstrates practical, scalable applications of AI in development data.

We also foster partnerships within the World Bank and across the global development and AI communities, supporting open-source standards, responsible AI adoption, and capacity building.

## Our Vision

By aligning technical innovation with the principles of openness, quality, and inclusion, **AI for Data – Data for AI** is building a future where development data is easier to find, more meaningful, and more empowering for everyone.
