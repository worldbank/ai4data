# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-centric Data Dissemination

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an **open standard** introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to simplify how large language models (LLMs) connect to external data sources and tools. Think of MCP as the "USB‑C of AI integrations"—a universal interface that enables AI systems, like Claude or ChatGPT, to tap into datasets, APIs, documents, or productivity tools without building bespoke integrations for each one.

For development data, MCP is a way to make it more accessible to AI systems by providing them with the context they need to understand and access data seamlessly. A well implemented MCP server for development data facilitates economies of scale since it can be used by multiple AI systems and tools without the need to build bespoke integrations for each one.

## How It Works

The MCP architecture is composed of three main components:

- **MCP Protocol**: A protocol that defines the interface between the MCP server and the MCP client.
- **MCP Server**: A server that implements the MCP protocol and provides the context to the LLM.
- **MCP Client**: A client that uses the MCP protocol to connect to the MCP server. This is the client that is used by the LLM to access the tools and resources provided by the MCP server.
