# Data Discoverability

## Overview

Data discoverability underpins one of the foundational pillars of AI-ready data, AI-ready data systems. It refers to the ability to efficiently locate and access datasets that are relevant to a user's needs, even when the user cannot specify exact dataset names or metadata. This is especially important in the context of development data, where information is often fragmented, diverse, and described in different ways across sources. Effective data discoverability empowers users—including researchers, policymakers, and practitioners—to find and leverage data that might otherwise remain hidden or underutilized.

## How It Works

Modern approaches to data discoverability leverage AI models and specialized search systems to go beyond simple keyword matching. These systems use combinations of techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), vector search for semantic searchability, and more recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) to interpret the intent and context behind user queries.

In practice, this means users can ask questions or search using natural language, and the system will return the most relevant data assets based on an understanding of both the query and the available datasets, improving the chances of finding the information they need.
